== Adapters

=== Purpose

This section describes the supported XML adapters, their capabilities, and
how to choose the right adapter for your needs.

=== What are adapters?

Moxml uses an adapter pattern to provide a unified interface over different
XML processing libraries. Each adapter wraps a specific XML library (Nokogiri,
LibXML, Oga, REXML, or Ox) and provides consistent behavior through Moxml's
API.

=== Available adapters

link:nokogiri[Nokogiri adapter]::
Industry standard XML library with excellent performance and full XPath 1.0
support. Recommended for most use cases.

link:libxml[LibXML adapter]::
Alternative to Nokogiri using native libxml2 bindings. Excellent performance
with full feature support.

link:oga[Oga adapter]::
Pure Ruby XML parser with no C extensions. Ideal for JRuby, TruffleRuby, or
environments where C extensions are not allowed.

link:rexml[REXML adapter]::
Ruby standard library XML parser. Always available, requiring no additional
gems. Best for maximum portability.

link:ox[Ox adapter]::
Fastest XML parser with minimal memory footprint. Best for simple documents
and high-throughput scenarios.

=== Adapter comparison

Refer to the link:../compatibility[Compatibility matrix] for detailed
feature comparison across all adapters.

| Maximum performance
| link:ox[Ox] or link:libxml[LibXML]

| Pure Ruby environment
| link:oga[Oga]

| No external dependencies

=== Switching adapters

Change adapters at runtime:

[source,ruby]
----
# Global default
Moxml::Config.default_adapter = :libxml

# Per instance
context = Moxml.new
context.config.adapter = :oga

# With configuration
moxml = Moxml.new do |config|
  config.adapter = :nokogiri
  config.strict_parsing = true
end
