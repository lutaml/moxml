== Ox adapter

=== Overview

Ox is the fastest XML parser available for Ruby, providing excellent performance for simple to moderately complex XML documents.

**Best for:**
* Maximum parsing speed
* Simple document structures
* Memory-constrained environments
* When XPath usage is minimal

== Specific adapter limitations

=== Ox adapter

==== XPath limitations

The Ox adapter uses a custom "XPath-to-locate" translation engine.

The following XPath features are NOT supported:

* Attribute value predicates: `//book[@id='123']` ❌
* Logical operators: `//book[@id and @title]` ❌
* Position predicates: `//book[1]`, `//book[last()]` ❌
* Text predicates: `//book[text()='Title']` ❌
* Namespace queries: `//ns:element` ❌
* Parent axis: `//child/..` ❌
* Sibling axes: `following-sibling::*` ❌
* XPath functions: `count()`, `concat()`, etc. ❌

*Workaround:* Use Ruby enumerable methods after basic queries:

[source,ruby]
----
# Instead of: doc.xpath("//book[@id='123']")
# Use:
doc.xpath("//book").find { |book| book["id"] == "123" }
----

IMPORTANT: For complete XPath 1.0 specification with zero limitations today, use
Nokogiri or Oga adapters.
