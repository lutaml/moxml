== Moxml: Modern XML processing for Ruby

image:https://github.com/lutaml/moxml/workflows/rake/badge.svg["Build Status", link="https://github.com/lutaml/moxml/actions?workflow=rake"]
image:https://img.shields.io/gem/v/moxml.svg["Gem Version", link="https://rubygems.org/gems/moxml"]

Moxml provides a unified, modern XML processing interface for Ruby
applications. It offers a consistent API that abstracts away the underlying
XML implementation details while maintaining high performance through
efficient node mapping and native XPath querying.

== Key features

* **Unified interface** - Consistent API across different XML libraries
* **Multiple adapters** - Support for Nokogiri, LibXML, Oga, REXML, and Ox
* **Full XPath support** - Native XPath querying with namespace handling
* **Ruby-idiomatic** - Natural, expressive API for XML manipulation
* **High performance** - Efficient node mapping and adapter optimization
* **Thread-safe** - Safe for concurrent operations
* **Complete node support** - Handle all XML node types

== Quick example

[source,ruby]
----
require 'moxml'

# Parse XML
doc = Moxml.new.parse('<library><book id="1">Ruby</book></library>')

# Query with XPath
books = doc.xpath('//book[@id="1"]')
puts books.first.text  # => "Ruby"

# Modify content
books.first.text = 'Advanced Ruby'
books.first['edition'] = '2nd'

# Output formatted XML
puts doc.to_xml(indent: 2)
